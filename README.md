# Scraping PDFs from the internet and summarizing their contents as .txt files

You may have a reference list provided by someone or Chat-GPT. Using the SemiautoSearchOnNet/search_and_download.py script and an input .txt file, you can search for and download those documents (.pdf or .html files that can be printed as .pdfs) from the internet with the following command:
> python search_and_download.py input_file output_folder

For the downloaded .pdf files, you can summarize their contents using a combination of Automator & "Text > Summarize" with some shell scripts and Python code (by executing Automator.workflow on macOS).

However, you need to define the following shell environment variables if you want to use the Google search API:

> # Google Search via API

> export GOOGLE_API_KEY="XXXXXX"

> export GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="YYYYYY"


Good luck!

Here's an example of the input_file (.txt):

AI Beginner's Image Generation
Model: GPT-4

Q: 
Good morning, GPT-4! I have another question for you today. I want to know how to learn about generative AI, especially for image generation. Can you provide me with a list of PDFs that are good references for beginners in the field of AI technology? Please sort the list by priority or importance based on your understanding and recommendation. The first item(s) on the list should be introductory documents. Can you help me with this? Thank you in advance, mate or buddy.

A:
Good morning! I'm happy to help you learn about generative AI for image generation. Here's a list of PDFs and online resources, sorted by priority and importance, that can help you get started as a beginner in this field:

- "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville
Book PDF: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/generative_models.html
This book is an excellent introductory material for deep learning and contains a dedicated chapter on generative models, which is the foundation for generative AI in image generation.

- "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)" by Ian Goodfellow et al.
Original Paper PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf
GANs are one of the most popular techniques for generating images. This original paper will give you an understanding of the basic concept and architecture of GANs.

- "A Beginner's Guide to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)" by Jonathan Hui
Online Article: https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/gan-whats-generative-adversarial-networks-and-its-application-f39ed278ef09
This article provides a gentle introduction to GANs, their applications, and their different types, making it an excellent starting point for beginners in AI technology.

- "Understanding Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)" by Francois Chollet
Book Excerpt PDF: https://d2l.ai/_downloads/en/pdf/Generative_Adversarial_Networks.pdf
This excerpt from the book "Deep Learning with Python" provides a high-level introduction to GANs, explaining their core ideas and advantages.

- "Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs)" by Mehdi Mirza and Simon Osindero
Original Paper PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf
cGANs are a variant of GANs that allow you to generate images conditioned on certain attributes. This paper explains the concept and architecture of cGANs.

- "Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation" by Tero Karras et al.
Original Paper PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10196.pdf
This paper presents an advanced GAN architecture that generates high-quality images at multiple resolutions, which is important for creating realistic images.

- "StyleGAN: A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks" by Tero Karras et al.
Original Paper PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf
StyleGAN is another advanced GAN architecture that has been widely used for generating high-quality images. This paper will help you understand the technique and its applications.

Remember that generative AI is a rapidly evolving field, and it's essential to keep up-to-date with new research and developments. Be sure to follow top AI conferences (such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR) and online resources like arXiv to stay current with the latest advancements in generative AI for image generation. Good luck with your learning journey, mate!
