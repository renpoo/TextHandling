# Scraping those PDF(s) on NET, and Summarize its contents as .txt

You might have some sort of a Reference list, obtained by someone or Chat-GPT.
According to the .txt, SemiautoSearchOnNet/search_and_download.py script can search and download the those documents (.pdf or .html to be printed as .pdf) from internet.
> python search_and_download.py input_file output_folder

And for those downloaded .pdf(s), you can summarize its contents (each) by combination of Automator & "Text > Summarize" with some shell scripts and python codes (by executing Automator.workflown on macOS).





The example of input_file (.txt) is as below.

AI Beginner's Image Generation
Model: GPT-4

Q: 
Good Morning, Sir., GPT-4!!
Today, I have an another question.
It is about "How to learn the GENERATIVE AI, especially for Image Generation".
Could you show me the list of .pdf(s) as Good References for AI tech beginner.
Please sort the list by priority or importance with your understanding and recommendation.
The first(s) of the list might be the introductory document(s).
Could you do it?
Thanks in advance, Mate, or Buddy.

A:
Good morning! I'm happy to help you learn about generative AI for image generation. Here's a list of PDFs and online resources, sorted by priority and importance, that can help you get started as a beginner in this field:

Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville:

This book serves as an excellent introductory material for deep learning and contains a dedicated chapter on generative models, which is the foundation for generative AI in image generation.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by Ian Goodfellow et al.:
Original Paper PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf
GANs are one of the most popular techniques for generating images. This original paper will give you an understanding of the basic concept and architecture of GANs.
A Beginner's Guide to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by Jonathan Hui:
Online Article: https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/gan-whats-generative-adversarial-networks-and-its-application-f39ed278ef09
This article provides a gentle introduction to GANs, their applications, and their different types, making it an excellent starting point for AI tech beginners.
Understanding Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by Francois Chollet:
Book Excerpt PDF: https://d2l.ai/_downloads/en/pdf/Generative_Adversarial_Networks.pdf
This excerpt from the book "Deep Learning with Python" provides a high-level introduction to GANs, explaining their core ideas and advantages.
Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) by Mehdi Mirza and Simon Osindero:
Original Paper PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf
cGANs are a variant of GANs that allow you to generate images conditioned on certain attributes. This paper explains the concept and architecture of cGANs.
Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation by Tero Karras et al.:
Original Paper PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10196.pdf
This paper presents an advanced GAN architecture that generates high-quality images at multiple resolutions, which is important for creating realistic images.
StyleGAN: A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks by Tero Karras et al.:
Original Paper PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf
StyleGAN is another advanced GAN architecture that has been widely used for generating high-quality images. This paper will help you understand the technique and its applications.
Remember that generative AI is a rapidly evolving field, and it's essential to keep up-to-date with new research and developments. Be sure to follow top AI conferences (such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR) and online resources like arXiv to stay current with the latest advancements in generative AI for image generation. Good luck with your learning journey, mate!
